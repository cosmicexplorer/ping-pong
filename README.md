ping-pong
=========

A "code review" system that tries to inspire more lightweight back-and-forth.

# TODO

- *when this is more complete, keep a running tally of the software this heavily depends on (e.g. git) and put them in a list near the TOP of this readme -- it could be a nice way to say thanks + lead people to documentation for those tools, which will help when using this tool (if this tool doesn't virtualize any of them too much)*

## MVP

- [ ] git-notes backend for whatever the heck a *ping* is

## Next

- [ ] check out github PRs by number
    - don't do anything magit already does
- [ ] *extremely* thin cli
    - no daemon/persistent process right now
    - [ ] make pings
        - no location right now
    - [ ] query the engine (how?)
