=========

A "code review" system that tries to inspire more lightweight back-and-forth.

# TODO

## MVP

- [ ] git-notes backend for whatever the heck a *ping* is

## Next

- [ ] check out github PRs by number
    - don't do anything magit already does
- [ ] *extremely* thin cli
    - no daemon/persistent process right now
    - [ ] make pings
        - no location right now
    - [ ] query the engine (how?)
